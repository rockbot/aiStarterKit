# AI Starter Kit
aka rockbot is playing around with AI and didn't know where to start, so now she's sharing it with the world. :-D 

## What to expect
I've started playing around a little bit, but I realize there are maybe a lot of other folks who like to write code but are maybe a bit daunted by the constant barrage (and quickly shifting winds!) of AI things. So I'm doing this rather publicly for anyone else who might be interested in following along. I am doing this on my own time, for fun - if you find it helpful, [I am accepting tips](https://buy.stripe.com/8wMeXbfZv6a4gLe8ww). 

Feedback (of the actionable and/or complimentary sort) is welcome - create an issue or send me an email at raquel@rckbt.me.
